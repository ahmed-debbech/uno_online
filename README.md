# Uno Online!
This is just a very experimental work to grasp the Native Web technologies (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHPv7, AJAX, JQuery). \

I created the universal classic Uno game from scratch as a Web Development Project.

### Where to go:
The game is hosted on: https://unoonline1.000webhostapp.com/ or http://unoonline.42web.io/ \
Open the website and create room and share the code with your friends to join you and start the match. \
**For Developers:** \
Structure of the project: 
/core : contains the core engine of the entire game.
|_____ /core/game: contains the core engine of the game logic.
|_______________ /core/game/ajax: contains the scripts that refreshes the page with AJAX
/entities: contains all model classes of the entire game.
|_________ /entities/game: all the model classes of entire game.
/assets: contains all the resouces.
|_______ /assets/cards_templates: uno cards are made up of pure html and css so these files contain them.
|________ /assets/css: contains all the stylesheets of the the project
|________ /assets/js: contains all java script code of the project as well as AJAX ones.
|_________ /assets/res: all the media are there.
